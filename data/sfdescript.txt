Solar Flare dataset

1: Description.

The database describes (using 11 attributes) certain types of solar flares occured in a 24 hour period. Each instance represents captured features for 1 active region on the sun. 

Attributes description: 
1. LargestSpotSize: Code for largest spot size (X,R,S,A,H,K) 
2. SpotDistribution: Code for spot distribution (X,O,I,C) 
3. Activity (1 = reduced, 2 = unchanged) 
4. Evolution (1 = decay, 2 = no growth, 3 = growth) 
5. Prev24Hour: Previous 24 hour flare activity code (1 = nothing as big as an M1, 2 = one M1, 3 = more activity than one M1) 
6. HistComplex: Historically-complex (1 = Yes, 2 = No) 
7. BecomeHist: Did region become historically complex on this pass across the sun's disk (1 = yes, 2 = no) 
8. Area (1 = small, 2 = large) 
9. C-class: flares production by this region in the following 24 hours (common flares). 
10. M-class: flares production by this region in the following 24 hours (moderate flares). 
11. X-class: flares production by this region in the following 24 hours (severe flares).
